Welcome to my corner of the web.

As a MSc graduate in Artificial Intelligence my academic and professional journey has been anything but linear. Starting with a robust foundation in Chemistry, I transitioned into the dynamic field of AI, drawn by its potential to redefine problem-solving and innovation. This interdisciplinary background has endowed me with a unique perspective and a versatile skill set, bridging the gap between the theoretical and the practical, from the microscopic intricacies of single-atom catalysts to the expansive possibilities of machine learning and AI.

# Recent Activities

This past summer, my passion for AI led me to Seoul National University in South Korea, where I immersed myself in humanoid AI robotics during a summer exchange program. I not only expanded my technical skills in programming and computer vision but also embraced the cultural diversity and collaborative spirit of a global educational environment. This experience exapnded my perspective on the universal impact and applications of AI technologies across cultures and industries.
