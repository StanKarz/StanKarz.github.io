Welcome to my corner of the web.

My academic and professional journey has been anything but linear, taking me from the intricate world of Chemistry to the dynamic field of AI, drawn by its potential to redefine problem-solving and innovation. This interdisciplinary background has endowed me with a unique perspective and a versatile skill set, bridging the gap between the theoretical and the practical.

# Recent Activities

This past summer, my passion for AI led me to Seoul National University in South Korea, where I engaged in hands-on learning about AI in robotics during a summer exchange program. I had the opportunity to develop my technical skills in programming and computer vision but also embraced the cultural diversity and collaborative spirit of a global educational environment. This experience expanded my perspective on AI technologies' universal impact and applications across cultures and industries.

# Most Recent Role

Back in London, I embraced the opportunity to work as a Research Intern at University College London, in a dynamic research lab. I was tasked with implementing model-free reinforcement learning techniques focusing on Q-learning algorithms and investigating the effectiveness of various methods for adversarial attacks. This endeavour allowed me to dive deep into the nuances of AI research, from conception to execution and presentation. It was a hands-on exploration of reinforcement learningâ€™s potential and its challenges, further enhancing my skills in research methodologies and collaborative innovation.

# Beyond the Classroom

Prior to my postgraduate studies, I worked as a Customer Success Specialist at Paperform, where I honed my skills in client engagement, technical support, and cross-functional collaboration. This role taught me the importance of customer-centric product development and the value of clear, accessible user education.


# Skills and Tools

My technical toolkit is extensive, with advanced proficiency in Python, SQL, and a suite of data science libraries (PyTorch, fastai, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib) that complement my research and development projects. Iâ€™m also well-versed in Git and Visual Studio Code, tools that underpin my collaborative projects and version control needs.
